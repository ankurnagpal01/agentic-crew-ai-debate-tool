The mandatory usage of the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) in the software development process is essential for modern organizations aiming to maintain competitiveness, enhance productivity, and ensure high-quality deliverables. Firstly, SAFe promotes alignment across multiple teams, breaking down silos and fostering a culture of collaboration. By implementing standardized processes and roles, organizations can streamline their workflows, allowing for greater transparency and accountability. This, in turn, boosts overall efficiency.

Moreover, SAFe emphasizes the importance of delivering customer value incrementally. Through its structured approach to agile development, teams can release features and updates more frequently, gather user feedback, and make necessary adjustments on-the-fly. This responsiveness to change is critical in an era where customer needs evolve rapidly.

In addition, the robust training and resources provided within the SAFe framework equip teams with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in an agile environment. By mandating SAFe, organizations invest in their employees' professional development, resulting in a more competent and engaged workforce.

Finally, mandatory adoption of SAFe creates a common language and framework which facilitates better communication and understanding across all levels of an organization. This leads to improved project outcomes, as everyone is working towards a shared goal with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.

In conclusion, enforcing mandatory usage of SAFe in the software development process not only optimizes productivity and quality but also drives a culture of continuous improvement and customer-centricity. Organizations that embrace this framework will undoubtedly find themselves better equipped to thrive in today's fast-paced technological landscape.
